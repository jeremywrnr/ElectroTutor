    In this tutorial, we'll use the MPU6050 gyroscope, a NeoPixel Ring and an
    Arduino to build a device that lights LEDs corresponding to the angle of
    inclination.

    This is a simple and fun project and it's going to be assembled on a
    breadboard. If you'll follow the steps you'll build what you saw in the
    video. It's a good tutorial for learning about gyroscope and the NeoPixel
    Ring.

    I'm building this tutorial because of the interest i saw on some other
    tutorial of min. In this tutorial i've replaced simple led's with a NeoPixel
    Ring. The ring it's simpler to use through an Adafruit library and it's
    definitely more spectacular.

    So if you have these components lying around this is a great way to make use of
    them, i'll try to take you step by step through building the device and also
    explain how it works in the last step.

    Parts - 1. Arduino Pro Mini 328P, 2. Breadboard, 3. MPU6050 gyroscope, 4. 24
    NeoPixel LED Ring, 5. 4 x AA battery pack with 4 batteries, 6. U-shape
    jumper cables (optional). I've used these jumper cables because they look
    better on the breadboard, and the leds are more visible this way. You can
    find a box of 140 on ebay at about 4$. If you don't have these cables you
    can replace them with dupont wires.

    Tools - 1. USB to serial FTDI adapter FT232RL to programm the arduino pro
    mini, 2. Arduino IDE.

    Skills - 1. Soldering, 2. Basic arduino programming.

    I've attached the fritzing schematic in fzz format and a picture of it for easy visualization of the connections.
    1. You need to solder 3 male pins on the back of the neopixel ring like shown in the picture
    - solder the positive pin
    - solder the ground
    - solder the data input pin
    2. Then the 4x battery holder should have a way of a connecting to the breadboard, a easy solution is to solder two male dupont wires to it's terminals.
    3. Prepare the breadboard.
    - place the neopixel ring, microcontroller and gyroscope on the breadboard like in the image
    - place all the negative wires: to the microcontroller, neopixel ring, gyro
    - place all the positive wires: to the microcontroller, neopixel ring, gyro
    - place all the data wires:
    * SDA and SCL from the to the microcontroller to the gyro
    * pin D6 from the microcontroller to the neopixel ring
    - double check all connections before powering
    - optionally using duct tape, tape the battery pack on the back of the bradboard to hold it in place and make it more portable

  title: The Code and the Calibration

    Upload the code: Using the FTDI adapter upload the code to the arduino.

    Connect the power supply (batteries)

    For calibration: The most important thing to calibrate here is "LED_OFFSET" constant. In my
    example is 12. You need to adjust this from 0 to 23 so that after powering
    the board the led will light in the direction you tilt the board.
