            Connect the white pin to *5V* (red/power), and the black pin to *GND* (blue/ground).

            ![power](measure-power-crop.jpg)

            Press the button below to check the voltage.

        Connect the one side of the button to `GND` with a jumper wire.

        Connect the other side to *digital pin 2* on the Arduino board.

        ![button-in](button-in-crop.jpg)

        The button's legs are connected in pairs. When you press the button, you connect the pairs.

            The system will now check to see that you have wired up the board correctly.

            Does the Arduino light turn on as you push the button?

          onerror: Check that the wire between the button and the board is in the right place. Also make sure that probe is no longer connected to the button.

      title: Button Press Detection Code
      description: |
        Now that the button is connected, we need to detect when it is being pressed in software.

        At the top of the file, add this definition to set which Arduino pin the button is connected to.

        ```

        #define button 2
        #define outLED 13

        ```

        Next, add this code inside of the `setup()` function to add pin 2 as an input, using `pinMode`:

        ```

        pinMode(button, INPUT_PULLUP);
        pinMode(outLED, OUTPUT);

        ```

        Last, add this code to the `loop()` function to read the button's value.


        ```

        int press = !digitalRead(button);
        digitalWrite(outLED, press);

        ```

        This code will also copy the button state to the onboard Arduino LED.

        Next, connect the piezo buzzer to the third digital Arduino pin `(3)`.

        Connect the other end of the piezo to GND (the blue rail) with the resistor.

        To stop the beeping, press the *Upload* button in the Arduino IDE.

        Next, in software, set up the system to buzz whenever the button is pressed.

        Add two more statements at the top to define our buzzer pin and the note frequency.

        ```

        #define buzzer 4
        #define freq 220

        ```

        Then, at the bottom of `loop()` function, set the noise to play when the button is pressed:

        ```

        if (press) {
          tone(buzzer, freq, 10);
          delay(10);
        }

            ![piezo](measure-piezo-crop.jpg)

            The piezo will only beep when the button is pressed.

      title: Neopixel Ring Code
      description: |
        ![rain](rainbow.gif)

        Include code for the LED ring *at the VERY top* of the file:

        ```
        #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h>

        ```

        Then, define the pin the ring is connected to, and the number of "pixels" in the ring.

        ```

        #define PIN    7
        #define PIXELS 12

        ```

        *Before* the `setup()` function, initial the ring and a base white color.

        ```

        int color = 0;
        Adafruit_NeoPixel strip = Adafruit_NeoPixel(PIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800);
        uint32_t white = strip.Color(16, 16, 16); // dim white color

        ```

        Initialize the strip *just before* the end of `setup()` function.

        ```
        strip.begin(); // This initializes the NeoPixel library.
        strip.setBrightness(16);

        ```

        *In between* the `setup()` and `loop()` functions, insert these two light helper functions.

        ```

        uint32_t Wheel(byte WheelPos) {
            WheelPos = 255 - WheelPos;
            if (WheelPos < 85) {
                return strip.Color(255 - WheelPos * 3, 0, WheelPos * 3);
            }
            if (WheelPos < 170) {
                WheelPos -= 85;
                return strip.Color(0, WheelPos * 3, 255 - WheelPos * 3);
            }
            WheelPos -= 170;
            return strip.Color(WheelPos * 3, 255 - WheelPos * 3, 0);
        }

        void rainbow(int start, int wait) {
            int j = start;
            for (int q = 0; q < 3; q++) {
                for (int i = 0; i < strip.numPixels(); i = i + 3) {
                    strip.setPixelColor(i + q, Wheel( (i + j) % 255)); //turn every third pixel on
                }
                strip.show();
                delay(wait);

                for (int i = 0; i < strip.numPixels(); i = i + 5) {
                    strip.setPixelColor(i + q, 0);      //turn every third pixel off
                }
            }
        }

        ```

        *Replace the* `loop()` function content with these lines:

        Connect the negative `(-)` terminal to GND (blue/ground).

        Connect the the output pin to the Arduino's analog 5 pin `(A5)`.

        ![wiring](flashlight.jpg)

        You can use the flashlight to trigger the light sensor.

        Just below the Neopixel ibrary inclusion line, add this code snippet:

        ```

        #define light  A5
        #define thresh_lo 100
        #define thresh_hi 900

        ```

        This sets the light sensor pin and sensor level thresholds.

        In `setup()`, add the light sensor as an input:

        ```
        pinMode(light, INPUT_PULLUP);

        ```

        Replace the `loop()` content with this snippet:

        ```

        int level = analogRead(light);
        if (level > thresh_hi) {
            digitalWrite(outLED, HIGH);
        } else if (level < thresh_lo) {
            digitalWrite(outLED, LOW);
        }

        ```

        Now, the onboard Arduino's LED should activate when you flast the light sensor.
